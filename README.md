### :gear: Development Workflow

#### Making Changes
1. Create a new feature branch off of the `main` branch and name it with the number of the Issue you'll be working on (e.g. `issue01`).
2. Make changes and commit your changes to your feature branch with [Conventional Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) 
3. Once you're satisfied that your changes address the ticket, open a new pull request for your feature branch with the corresponding Issue ticket number and title as the PR title (e.g. issue08: Implement static version of vis1)
4. Fill out [PR template](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC447-2022W-T2/g02/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) when you post a PR
5. Resolve all merge conflicts as needed.
6. Assign other team members to review your PR and be open and available to address feedback.
7. Comment the PR link in the `issue` ticket.
8. After approval from the reviewer(s), confirm the PR and merge your feature branch into the `main` branch.
9. While merging your feature branch, always use `squash and merge`.
9. Confirm that your changes are reflected in the `main` branch, and then delete your feature branch.

#### Little Things to Note
1. Follow [Conventional Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) 
2. Use ISSUE number as branch name. (Ex. issue08)
3. Use ISSUE number + title as a PR title (Ex. issue08-Implement static version of vis1)
4. Fill out [PR template](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC447-2022W-T2/g02/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) when you post a PR

#### Branches
